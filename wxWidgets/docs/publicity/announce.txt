November 11, 2023 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.4 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.4

This release comes very soon after 3.2.3 because some of the changes
in the last release resulted in regressions fixed by this release.
Notably, 3.2.4 fixes a critical bug which made applications using wxGTK
but not initializing the GUI to crash (see issue #23981).

Other bug fixes include:

- Fix regression in wxTranslations::AddCatalog() return value (#24019).
- Fix possible crash and too high CPU use when using EGL (#24018).
- Fix losing clipboard contents when clearing a different selection (#23988).
- Fix possible crash when dragging pages in wxAuiNotebook (#24027).
- Fix refreshing multiple selection items in generic wxListCtrl.
- Fix showing windows for background apps under macOS Sonoma (#23893).

The only new addition in this release is the possibility to create objects
of wx legacy "dynamic arrays" class from std::initializer_list<> (#23966).

Please see the full change log for more details:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.4/docs/changes.txt

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
