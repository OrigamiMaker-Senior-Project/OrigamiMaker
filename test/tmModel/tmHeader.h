/*
Every TreeMaker source file includes this in its header tree. This file can be
precompiled. (Since it can be included from both C and C++ files, it is
standard C.) Note the symbols below that may be predefined in compilation:
TMDEBUG
TMPROFILE

You may also use the following macros:
TMASSERT(cond) -- to perform assertion tests.
TMLOG(text) -- to send information to a log window or standard output.

See discussion below for more details.

/**********
Assertions, debugging, and profiling

We define several macros that are used in debugging and/or profiling that
behave differently under various compile conditions. The macros are:

TMASSERT(cond) where cond is a condition that must always be true
TMLOG(text) where text is a string containing information to go to the
  debugging window or stdout.

The behavior of these macros is different depending on the compiler symbols
TMDEBUG and TMPROFILE.

You should #define no more than one of TMDEBUG or TMPROFILE.

TMDEBUG     -- define this for debug builds that don't include wxWidgets and
              for Development builds given to clients for user testing. This
              enables all assertions within TreeMaker code. Assertion failure
              gets reported to stdout.
              
TMPROFILE   -- define this for profiling builds, which will typically have all
              compiler optimizations, but which may still throw timing info
              to stdout.
              
            -- Don't define any of these for release builds. No
              assertions will be enabled and all log messages will be ignored.

TMASSERT() macro - used to test conditions that should be true (and about which
subsequent code will make assumptions).
TMFAIL() macro - used when program execution reaches a place that it shouldn't:
For example, a switch() statement that reaches the default state when it
shouldn't. The argument is a string giving the reason for failure. TMFAIL(msg)
is equivalent to TMASSERT(false) but lets us give a reason for the failure.
